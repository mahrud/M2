How to add syntax highlighting for packages:

Load package: loadPackage "YourPackage"

Find the dictionnary corresponding to the package: 
packDict = dictionaryPath#0

Find classes and add them to the "types" section:
select(values packDict, i -> class value i === Symbol) / toString // unique

Find functions and add them to the "function" section:
select(values packDict, i -> class value i === Symbol) / toString // unique

Note: single quotes ' in function names have to be escaped with another single quote ''.
